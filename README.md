# MEP_r scripts
R package(s) for reproducibility and efficiency of microbiome analyses.

## Motivation
To simplify analysis of REDCap exports for metadata analyses and summaries, statistical analysis, and vizualization, our most commonly used R functions from the MEP are stored in this repo.

## Description by function
- **get_prefix:** provided a list of sample names, a delimiter, and option to include human microbiome project (HMP) standard prefix of SRS, a list of unique prefixes is produced that can be used for analysis by prefix.
